# 🌐 Tomiwa Jinadu – Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio built with **React + Vite**, showcasing my skills, projects, and experiences as a software developer. The goal of this site is to serve as a professional online presence, highlighting my work in web and mobile development, as well as my interest in full-stack engineering, UI/UX, and emerging technologies.

## ✨ Inspiration

This portfolio was inspired by several developer portfolios across the web mainly http://pedrotech.co/. I drew particular inspiration from clean, modern, and accessible layouts to create something that reflects both my personality and engineering style.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **React** – Front-end framework for building user interfaces
* **Vite** – Blazing-fast build tool with HMR support
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
* **Lucide Icons** – Clean, open-source icon set
* **React Router** – Routing for multi-page navigation
* **Custom Hooks & Components** – Built for animations, toasts, forms, etc.

## 📁 Features

* Smooth transitions & animations
* Responsive design
* Section-based layout (About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
* Resume download & contact form with toast notification
* Clean, accessible UI using semantic HTML and ARIA-friendly components

## 🛠 Setup

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-portfolio-repo.git
   cd your-portfolio-repo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🧹 Linting & Clean Code

Basic ESLint rules are included for code consistency. If you're planning to expand the project into production-grade work, consider integrating TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io).

## 📌 Notes

* Built using [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react)
* Designed with simplicity and speed in mind
* Optimized for developer portfolio use cases
